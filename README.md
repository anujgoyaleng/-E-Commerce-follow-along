This project will guide you through building a full-stack e-commerce web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). You will learn how to implement key functionalities such as *user authentication, **product management, and *order handling while gaining hands-on experience with REST APIs, database schema design, and frontend development with React.

Key Features:
---
User Authentication: Secure login and registration with JWT.
Product Management: CRUD operations for products, with features like filtering and sorting.
Order Handling: Users can place and view orders.
REST API: Build scalable API endpoints for managing users, products, and orders.
Frontend: Responsive UI built with React for a smooth user experience.

Core Concepts:
---
MERN Stack: Using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js for full-stack development.
REST APIs: Design and develop API endpoints for user and product management.

Authentication:
--- 
Implement secure login and session management.
Database Schema: Design MongoDB schemas for users, products, and orders.
Next Steps:
Set up the development environment and install dependencies.
Implement a basic server using Node.js and Express.
Start building the React frontend and connect it to the backend.
Design MongoDB schemas for structured data storage.
This project will help you master the full-stack development process, from database to frontend, with a focus on scalability and user interaction.

# Milestone 4: User Management with File Uploads

This Node.js application demonstrates user creation, file uploads using Multer, and secure password management using bcrypt and JWT.

## Features

- *User Registration*: Securely create users with hashed passwords.
- *File Upload*: Upload user avatars with unique filenames.
- *JWT Authentication*: Generate and validate JSON Web Tokens.
- *Error Handling*: Robust error management using a custom ErrorHandler utility.

## Technologies Used

- *Node.js* with *Express.js*
- *Mongoose* for MongoDB
- *Multer* for file uploads
- *bcrypt.js* for password hashing
- *jsonwebtoken* for authentication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- MongoDB instance running
- .env file with the following variables:
