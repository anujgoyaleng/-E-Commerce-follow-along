# Milestone 12: My Products Page

## Overview
In this milestone, we will create a "My Products" page that displays all products added by a user based on their email. We will accomplish this by writing a backend endpoint to fetch products from MongoDB filtered by the user's email and dynamically displaying them on the frontend using the previously created product card component.

## Learning Goals üéØ
By the end of this milestone, you will:

- Learn how to write an endpoint to filter and send data from MongoDB based on a user's email.
- Understand how to fetch and receive data on the frontend.
- Display data dynamically using a product card component.

## Steps to Complete Milestone 12 üìù

### Backend:
1. **Create an endpoint** in your backend application that retrieves all products associated with a user's email from MongoDB.
2. **Filter products** based on the email provided in the request.
3. **Send the filtered data** as a response to the frontend.

### Frontend:
1. **Write a function** to fetch the filtered product data from the backend.
2. **Process the received data** and pass it to the product card component.
3. **Dynamically display** the products on the "My Products" page.

## Notes
- This lesson will help in understanding how to filter data based on specific constraints and send it to the client efficiently.
- Ensure proper error handling for scenarios where no products are found for a given email.

## Next Steps
- Enhance the UI with better styling and user experience.
- Implement pagination if needed for better performance.
- Add authentication checks to ensure only the logged-in user's products are displayed.


## Milestone 13: Updating Data in MongoDB

üìå Objective

In this milestone, we will implement an update feature for our application. This will include:

Creating an endpoint in the backend to update data in MongoDB.

Pre-filling a form with existing product details when the edit button is clicked.

Allowing users to modify the data and save changes.

 Backend: Implementing Update Endpoint

Step 1: Define the Update Route

In your Express server, create an endpoint that will handle update requests.
Step 2: Connect Endpoint to MongoDB

Ensure your database connection is set up in server.js or app.js.
Step 3: Add an Edit Button to Product Card

 ## Milestone 14: Deleting Data from MongoDB

üéØ Objective

In this milestone, we will implement a DELETE operation in MongoDB using an API endpoint. We will also integrate a delete button in the frontend to allow users to remove data from the database by sending the product ID to the backend.

üìå Steps to Implement
Create the Delete EndpointFrontend Implementation

Add a Delete Button

Modify your product card component (e.g., ProductCard.js) to include a delete button
‚úÖ Summary

Created a DELETE API endpoint in Express to remove a product by ID.

Added a delete button in the frontend to call the endpoint.

Ensured that the backend and frontend interact correctly to delete data.

This milestone provides a detailed understanding of handling DELETE operations in a full-stack application
